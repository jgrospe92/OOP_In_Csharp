# Object Oriented Programming in C#
- One of my assignment in application development is to built an Health application using OOP. It takes an input from the user and return the calculated heart rate and display a simple terminal output.

## About the Project
- A Target-heart-rate Calculator
- A Computerization of Health Records

## Target-Heart-Rate Calculator
- Takes inputs from the user
- Calculate **max heart rate** using the formula ( 220 - {age in years})
- Calculate **min target heart rate** using the formula ( max heart rate * 0.5)
- Calculate **max target heart rate** using the formula ( max heart rate * 0.85)

## Computerization of Health Records
- Takes inputs from the user
- It displays user health profile, it displays their names, birth year, age, height, weight, maximum heart rate, target heart rate, BMI numeric value and BMI text value.
- BMI formula  `weight(lbs) * 703 / height(inches) * height(inches)`
- BMI Text value returns:
  - underweight (less than 18.5)
  - Normal (between 18.5 & 24.9)
  - Overweight (between 25 and 29.9)
  - Obese (30 or greater)

- How to built an app in C# using OOP
- Using string interpolation to display a formatted text

## Found a bug?
- Create an issue or comment it down if you found a bug, I will try my best to fix it.
